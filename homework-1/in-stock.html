            This bulbflower naturalizes well in gardens. The bulb grows best<br>
            in well-drained soil high in humus. It will grow in lightly shaded forest areas and<br>
            on rocky outcrops as well as in open meadows or prairies. Additionally it is found<br>
            growing alongside streams and rivers. The plants may be divided in autumn after the<br>
            leaves have withered. Bulbs should be planted in the autumn. Additionally the plant<br>
            spreads by seed rather than by runners.

            With its deeply fragrant flowers -- scallop-edge bells that dangle above bright<br>
            emerald-green leaves -- this nearly deer-proof shade lover appears to be delicate in an<br>
            old-fashioned way. But the pretty plant is also an intrepid wanderer, spreading readily <br>
            and rapidly, and anyone who gardens in a small space will want to watch this perennial <br>
            to make sure it stays in bounds. Tolerates shade well. Warning: this plant is poisonous.

          <p>
            Crown imperials are strong-growing bulbous plants, making rapid growth in the spring,<br>
            flowering during April/early May and dying down in early summer. Best in raised beds <br>
            or planters. Does not tolerate shade; needs a warm, sunny position where it can be left <br>
            undisturbed for many years.

          <p>
            This species of buttercup can get up to 2 feet tall and has large showy blooms in a<br>
            variety of colors from May to June. Persian buttercups are most commonly grown from<br>
            tubers planted in the beginning of spring. Each plant will produce up to 70 blooms in<br>
            a season. Good for cooler weather; can tolerate light frost.

          <p>
            These charming little blooming plants hail from Argentina and Uruguay and form dense<br>
            clumps of perennial flowers to chase the winter doldrums away. These flowers spring<br>
            from fall planted bulbs. They can get up to half a foot tall with a similar spread.<br> 
            Each bulb will produce numerous flowering stems with slender, deeply green foliage. <br>
            Blooms are fragrant and star shaped with six blue or white petals.

          <p>
          We have a wide variety of tulips in many colors. Plant tulip bulbs in the fall, 6 to 8 weeks<br>
            before a hard frost is expected and when soils are below 60 degrees F.
